## Files

Primary code is in `harmonograph.js`. The `harmonograph.html` file is the entry point for the application.

There is also a `index.html` file which is a copy of `harmonograph.html` for easier loading with vite.

## Instructions

From the root folder:

```
npm install
npm start
```

To view `harmonograph.html`, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/harmonograph.html`.

Vite may serve on a different port, so check the console output for the correct port.

## Dependencies

Only two primary dependencies are used: `three` and `gl-matrix`. These are installed via npm.

`vite` is used for development, and is also installed via npm.
